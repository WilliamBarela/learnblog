Sinatra is an incredibly powerful backend micro-framework which gives you the power to make full scale CRUD applications following the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. Unlike massive frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Sinatra is currently less than 2000 lines of code. Thus, creating an application in Sinatra can directly translate into a better ability to understand the inner workings of complex MVC applications by not having so much "magic" as is given in Rails.

For that reason, I decided that one of the projects I wanted to build out is a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) application build in Sinatra. This last Spring semester my wife, who is a professor, decided to make her students record screencasts of themselves for assigned presentations. She also asked them to make a small introduction of themselves and record that so that the class could get to know all of their classmates in a more meaningful way. These presentations were to be done on YouTube and the link posted to a website similar to blackboard. Although with the rise of social media this was a good experience for the students, it was a little difficult for the students to have to search through the forum to find the links for each other. As a result, I was pleased to find a practical reason to build out an app in Sinatra.

Using bootstrap to give a little makeup to the frontend, I am happy to say that I am quite pleased with my work. Sinatra has proven to be a very powerful tool to futher my understanding of the deep internals of MVC and CRUD operations. An added bonus is that I can see how this web application will grow into a very useful and used application which my wife, her students, and her university will employ. I am looking forward to building out the views and routes for the comments section for the presentations.
